# Elang Documentation

This document contains documentation for the experiment language.

## Structure

The following structure is enforced on programs:

-  Val and gvar definiton block
-  Function definiton block
-  Phase definition block
-  Transition block
    
**Example**

    #Val and gvar definition block"
    gvar g1 <- "global var"
    gvar g2 <- 56
    val a <- "a"
    .
    .
    .
    #end of block
 
    #Function definition block 
    function test()
      helptext("test")
    end

    function helloworld()
      showmsg("Hello world")
     end
     .
     .
     .
    #end of function block

    #Phase definitions
    intermezzo-phase phase1
      showmsg("In phase1")
      wait(5000)
    end

    information-phase phase2
      showmsg("In phase2")
      wait(5000)
    end

    intermezzo-phase phase3
      showmsg("In phase3")
      wait(5000)
    end
    #End of phase definitionsd


    #Transition definations
    transition
      start(phase1)
      phase1 -> phase2
      phase2 -> phase3
      final(phase3)
    end

    ##End of program


## Variables

Variables are containers that can store a value. A variable is created by using the approperiate keyword and assigning a value to it. "val a <- "abc" creates a variable named a that contains the value "abc". The value can then be used by using the variables name. Variable definitions should be in the beginning of a function.
    
    var a <- "abc"
    showmsg(a)  # Displays abc on the screen

A existing variable can be given a new value by using the assignment operator <-. 
    
    var a <- 41  # a contains the number 41
    a <- 66      # 66 is assign to a, the old value(41) is forgotten

There are three different types of variables; 

-  **gvar** Global variable, useable everywhere
-  **val** static global value, cannot be modified after definition
-  **var** Normal variable, usable only inside the function/phase where it's defined.

.

    gvar a <- 55

    information-phase Phase1
      var b <- "Variable b" 
      #Both  a and b are visible here
    end

    information-phse Phase2
      # A is visible but b isn't
    end
    
## Values

Elang supports 5 different values or data types; boolean values, numbers, strings, arrays and objects.

#### Boolean
A boolean value can be either true or false. 

#### Numbers
Numbers can be any whole or decimal number where . is used as the decimal. 

#### Strings
A string is a sequence of characters defined by being surrounded by " ". For example "This is a string".

#### Arrays
An array is a list like structure that contains a set of values in a certain order. An array is defined with space separated values surrounded by square brackets, eg. ** var array <- [1 5 10 15 20]. Accessing of a individual value in the array is done with array[index] where index is a number corresponding to the values position in the array starting from 0.Â´So array[0] corresponds to the value 1 while array[3] corresponds to 15. The arrays values and indexes is shown in the table below. 

| array | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
|-------|---|---|----|----|----|
| index | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  |   


    
    var arr <- ["oh" "hi" "there"]
    # index    [  0    1      2 ]
    # arr contains 3 elemts "oh", "hi" and "there".
    #
    helptext(arr[1])
    # Writes "hi" ti the 

#### Objects


## Phases and transitions

Program flow is contolled with phases and phase trasnsitions. There are two types of phases; intermezzo-phases and interaction phases. The intermezzo phase is more simple and is just run from the beginning to the end while the interaction phase has more support for repeating actions. Phases are defined with the correscponding keyword followed a name, and the phases is anded with the **end** command.

    #Simple intermezzo phase definition
    intermezzo-phase FirstPhase
      # Doing stuff
      # Moar stuff
      # Even moar stuff
    end
    
The interaction phase as some mandatory extra control structures, **enterphase**, **leavephase**, **beforeiteration**, **afteriteration** and **iteration**. Commands inside enterphase are run once when the phase starts and leavephase behaves in the same way when the phase ends.

A set of stimuli should be defined in each iterationphase, usually in enterphase using the setstimuli() function. The set stimuli function accepts an array (e.g. [5 3 4]) with stimuliobjects and iteration is run once for each object. Before and afteriteration are run before/after each iteration and can be used for example to store data and clean up after an iteration/ prepare for the next iteration. See the stimuli topic for more information.
    
    interaction-phase MainPhase
        enterphase
            showmsg("Entering phase")
            # Setting two stimuli, 1 and 2
            setstimuli([1 2)])  
        end
        
        leavephase
            showmsg("Leaving phase")
        end
        
        beforeiteration
            showmsg("Start iteration")
        end
        
        afteriteration
            showmsg("End iteration")
        end
        
        iteration
            # Stimulus returns the current stimuli, 1 in the first iteration
            # and 2 in the second one.
            showmsg(append("Stimulus nr " stimulus()))
        end
    end
    
    # Output:
    # Entering phase
    # Start iteration
    # Stimulus nr 1
    # End iteration
    # Start iteration
    # Stimulus nr 2
    # End iteration
    # Leaving phase
    

The order in which phases are run is defined in the transition block that should be placed after all phase definitions in the code. A very simple tranition definition could look like this:

    transition
      start(firstPhase),
      firstPhase -> secondPhase,
      secondPhase -> lastPhase,
      final(lastPhase)
    end

The transition definition starts with the keyword **transition**, followed by a list of phase tranistion separated by a commas (**,**). The starting phase is defined first using the **start**(_phaseName_) command and the last phase is lastly defined in the same way with the **final**(_phaseName_) command. These phases (start, final) should **only** be reachable once, ie at the beginning end of the program.

Phases transition are  defined in any order using the _fromPhase_ **->** _toPhase_ command, until all phases have been visited atleast once.

It's also possible to include a conditional transition by adding **if** _boolean expression_ after the transition, e.g. phase1 -> phase2 if(_boolean expression_). This transition will only occure if the boolean expression returns true, making it possible to choose how a program should progress. 

In the example below the phase *add_a* is repeated as long as a is less than 5, and add_a transitions into lastPhase when a is greater than 4, i.e. when it reaches 5.

        gvar a <- 0

        intermezzo-phase first
          a <- 0
        end

        intermezzo-phase add_a
            helptext(a)
            a <- plus(a 1)
        end

        intermezzo-phase lastPhase
            helptext("Reached lastphase")
        end

        transition
          start(first),
          first -> increment_a,
          add_a -> add_a if(lt(a 5)),
          add_a -> lastPhase if(gt(a 4)),
          final(lastPhase)
        end

        Result:
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
        Reached lastphae

        Tranisitions
        first->add_a->add_a->add_a->add_a->add_a->lastPhase

**Warning:** It's up to the user to make sure that test don't end up in a so calle infinite loop, where it never reaches the final tranisiton and just repeats something _ad infinum_.
    
## Functions

A function is a named sequence of a program that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can the be used, or called, whenever this task need to be performed. Elang comes with a set of predefined functions for common task (documented below) and users can also define their own functions. 

##### Using functions
A function is called or excecuted using it's name, followed by function arguments surrounded by parntheses, e.g. **add(1 2)**. Functions can also return a result which can be used in the same way as a value. The **add(a b)** accepts two arguments, a and b, and returns the addition of theses valuse (a + b).

    var a <- 5
    var b <- 10

    var c <- add(a b)
    c will contain 15. 

    var d <- add(10 10)
    d contains 20

##### Defining functions
Functions should be defined in the function definitn block, after variables and before phases. A example function could look like this:
    
    # Functions that computes number^2
    function powerOfTwo(number)
      var result <- multiply(number number)
      return result
    end

    # usage
    var b <- powerOfTwo(5)
    # b = 25

So a function is defined with the keyword function followed by it's name. A function can accept any number of parameters or no parameters at all, contained inside the bracket separated by a space. The function body should start with variable definitions, same way as in phases, and can then perform any number of commands. The **return** keyword specifies that a value is returned from the function and the function stops executing.

    function returnZero()
        return 0

        # The function stops executing after the return statement
        # so return 10 is never run
        return 10
    end

    var a <- returnZero()
    # a = 0

## Builtin functions

Elang comes with a set of built in functions for performing common tasks. These functions are pretty much necessary when building tests so it's usefull to be familiar with them. 

### Display

Display positions are defined as the number of pixels from the top-left corner of the display. Positions are defined as a json object with two variables; top and left, .e.g. the position {top:50 left:100} is located 100 pixels to the right and 50 pixels below the topleft corner. 

**show(displayobject position)**
Displays an object at the specified position.

**hide(displayobject)**
Hides the specified object.


#### DisplayObjects

All displayobjects share the same functionality regarding showing and hiding them. And they must be defined and assigned to a variable before being used. 

**msgbox(message, fontsize=20)**
Displayobject for displaying text at any location. Fontsize is an optional argument and it defaults to 20

**imagefile(imageurl)**
Object containing a image specified by the url, so images can either be uploaded to the testeditor or fetched from the internet. Note that images on the net can disappear or change at any time.  The image is displayed without any scaling so make sure that the image is the right size. 

**rectangle(width height borderwidth=2)**
Displays a rectangle with the given width height and borderwidth. Borderwidth is an optional argument and defaults to 2. 


It's also possible to display simple text messages using showmsg(message) and hidemsg() without any further specifications. This just shows/hides a message at location {top:50 left:50}

**showmsg(message)**
Displays a message at the standard message location in the top right corner

**hidemsg()**
Hides the standard message.

### Input



#### Mouse

**onmouseclick(imagefile, {action: function, inputid: number, resettimer: bool})**

Creates a mouseclick listener for the object/image, which will be triggered when the image is clicked. The function specified in "action" is executed on each click. 

**onmouseclick(imagefile, false)**

Removes all mouseclick functions bound to the specified object.

####Keyboard

**onkeypress(key, func)**

Binds the specified key to a function so that the function is run every time when the key is pressed.

**onkeypress(key)**

Removes all actionss bound to the specified key.

    function leftclick()
        showmsg("left was clicked")
    end

    onkeypress("left", leftclick)

Example: the function leftclick is run each time when the left arrow is clicked on the keyboard.

**onanykey(func ignore=[])**

Runs the specified function on all keypresses.

**onanykey(func ignore="")**

Executes the specified function when any keyboeard key except keys specified ignore are pressed. Ignored keys should be sent as an array of individual keynames, for example ["a" "enter"] ignores the keys **a** and **enter**, see the keycode table for the correct key names. 


Ignore can also accept a special command "onlyletters" which ignores everything but a-z.
    onanykey(resume() "onlyletters").

**onanykey()**

Removes all actions bound with __onanykey__

**resumeonkey(keycode)**

Runs resume() once when the specified key is clicked. 

**resumeonkey()**

Runs resume() on any keypress once. 

**getlastkey()**

Returns the most recent keypress as a string. 

### Arithmetic

#### Basic
**plus(number1 number2)** number1 + number2

**minus(number1 number2)** number1 - number2

**multiply(number1 number2)** number1 * number2

**divide(number1 number2)** number1 / number2

#### Logic
**not(boolean)**

**and(bool1 bool2)**

**or(bool1 bool2)**

**lessthan(number1 number2 _or_ lt(number1 number2))** number1 < number2

**greaterthan(number1 number2) _or_ gt(number1 number2)** number1 > number2

**equal(number1 number2) _or_ eq(number1 number2)** number1 == number2


### Functions

### Arrays/Strings

**append(string1 string2)**

Appends two strings

**lenght(object)**

Returns the number of elements/letters in a array or string

**elementatindex(object, index)**

Returns the element at the specified index in the object/string, starting from zero.


#### Random numbers

**randominteger(min, max)**

returns a pseudorandom non decimal number within the range.

**randomnumber(min, max)**

Returns a pseudorandom number value within the range

**seedrandom(seed)**

Seeds the random generator with  a value. A certain seed will always produce the same sequence of random values. 

#### Time and timers

**recordts()**

Returns a timestamp with the current time with millisecond precision. Timestamps can easily be compared with basic arithmetic operations.

**starttimer()**

Starts the timer.

**elapsedtime()**

Returns time elapsed, in ms, since the last call top starttimer. Returns 0 if no timer has been started. 

#### Result storage

Results are stored as .csv spredsheet files that can easily be imported into Excel or any other spreadsheet software. Data can be stored in two different files:
-   Aggregate data from the whole experiment, can only contain one row per user. 
-   "Raw data", test specific data, so each test (in the same experiment) writes to a separate file. Allows for multiple rows per user. It's possible to compute e.g. an average over all rows and store this value in the aggregate datatable. 

**storeSingle(field data)**

Stores a single value with the specified fieldname in the aggregated datatable.

**storeRow(string field data)**

Stores a value with the given fieldname in the current raw datarow. 

**newRow()**

Creates a new empty row to write raw data to.

The example produces the following result:

##### Data processing and aggregation

Raw data can be processed to something more usable. An aggregation function loops through the whole raw data table and performs the specified function on every field that it finds. Rows that don't have any value in the specific field are simply omitted. Results are stored in the processed data table in the fi

**count(field)**

Counts how many rows contain the specific field.

**count(field, value)**

Counts how many rows contain a specific field with a specific value.

**average(field)**

Computes the average value from all rows containing this field.


    #Example
    
    #Adding values to first row
    storeRow("Row number" 1)
    storeRow("TestValue" 5)
    storeRow("Message" "Hello")

    newRow()
    storeRow("Row number" 2)
    storeRow("TestValue" 5)
    storeRow("Message" "Hello")

    newRow()
    storeRow("Row number 3")
    storeRow("TestValue" 14)
    storeRow("Message" "Goodbye")
    storeRow("ExtraValue" "Extra")

    count("RowNumber")       # How many rows in coloumn "RowNumber" contain a value
    count("ExtraValue")      # How many rows in coloumn "ExtraValue" contain a value
    count("Message" "Hello") # How many rows in coloumn "Message" contain the value "Hello"
    average("TestValue")     # Avarage of all values in the TestValue coloumn

    storeSingle("Single Value" 1234567)

**Raw Data** 

| Row Number | TestValue | Message  | ExtraValue |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|
|     1      |     5     | "Hello"  |            |
|     2      |     5     | "Hello"  |            |
|     3      |     14    | "Goodbye"|   "Extra"  |

**Aggregate Data**

| count_RowNumber | count_ExtraValue | count_Message_Hello | average_TestValue| Single Value |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
|       3         |        1         |          2          |       8          |   1234567    |
