# Questionnaire Markup Language Guide

## Plain text

There are several commands available to format plain text. They are the subject of this section.

## Next-line arguments

When we say that a command accepts a “next-line argument,” we mean that the argument to the command is on the next line of the markup.

To demonstrate, the following command could be used to produce the title of this section. (*/title* requires a next-line argument.)

    /title
    Next-line arguments

## Stack arguments

Two commands - */ts* and */bs* - operate on **stacks**. They differ in their scope. The scope of */ts* is always a single paragraph, whereas the scope of */bs* may be several paragraphs. As it has a more restricted scope, */ts* has a higher precedence than */bs* when they conflict with each other.

There are three fundamental stack operations - *push*, *pop*, and *empty*. All of these operations involve [text styles](# text styles).

**push** places a style on top of the stack. *push* can be abbreviated as "+".

**pop** removes the style off of the stack, which was inserted (i.e. pushed) last. *pop* can be abbreviated as "-"

**empty** clears the whole stack; i.e., it basically calls *pop* repeatedly, until there is nothing more to *pop*. *empty* can be abbreviated as "!".

In the example to follow, '[]' denotes an empty stack. (Do not mistake it for an array, however.) The leftmost element is considered the top of the stack.
